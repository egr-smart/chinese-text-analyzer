# Chinese Text Analyzer
A tool to analyse the complexity of Chinese texts, as determined by the percentage of words in that text belonging to each HSK (a chinese language standardised testing system) level's vocabulary list.

It will initally be a command line tool, but I later plan to build it into an API and give it a frontend for ease of use.
